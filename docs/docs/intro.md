## Welcome to the Brainstorm
---

**[brainsatplay.js](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay) is an AGPL-licensed JavaScript framework enabling the inclusion of real-time physiological data streams in modern web applications.** Our team has used it to [distribute standalone biosensing applications](https://app.brainsatplay.com) on web browsers, support social connection through multiplayer experiences, and [simply play around](https://app.brainsatplay.com/#studio) with real-time physiological data. We're excited to see what you create with us!

## Getting Started
---

While everyone begins in different places, we encourage all of our **Brainstormers** to use the following four stages to guide their progression from a *user* of Brains@Play solutions to an active *contributor* to our growing community of open technology creators.

### 1. Explore the Platform
To experience web-based biosensing applications developed by others, head over to our [Platform](./platform/01-using-the-platform) tutorial.


### 2. Play with the Studio
To start playing with the integration of real-time physiological data streams into your own application, jump to our [Studio](./studio/01-using-the-studio) tutorial.

### 3. Develop using the Library
To integrate the Brains@Play software framework into your own projects, open our [Library](./library/01-using-the-library) tutorial.

### 4. Contribute to the Codebase
To contribute to the core Brains@Play codebase, check out our 

Additional content about integrating with other software can be found on our **Beyond the Web** section.
